![Laravel App on AWS](/images/1__cHw6zbAivDFI__aZkeN1mjg.png)

### Introduction
In this article, we will deploy a Laravel web application on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and we will scale it across several instances. These instances will share a single **MySQL** database that will be deployed on the [Amazon Relational Database Service(RDS).](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)

We will also simulate failures of random instances to assess the behavior of the system in the event of a real-world problem that may impede the availability of our Laravel web application. The system will be fault-tolerant and designed to _fail with grace_, performing regular health-checks on instances and spinning up new, healthier ones to replace failed ones.

### **Amazon EC2**

[Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Think of it as a personal computer, but in the cloud. With complete control of computing capacity, **Amazon EC2** takes web-scale cloud computing to the next level for developers.

To get the ball rolling, you will need to [create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), if you don’t already have one. The **Free-Tier account** will enable you to use and familiarize yourself with some of the AWS platforms, products, and services.

Once you have done that, head on to the EC2 dashboard.

### **Launching the instance**

To launch an instance, click on the **Launch Instance** button. You will be taken to a launch instance wizard page that contains a list of [Amazon Machine Image(AMI)s](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) which provides important information required to launch an instance. You have to specify a source AMI when launching an instance.

Select the **Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type** which comes with preconfigured installations of PHP, Python, MySQL, Docker and other essential packages to get you up and running as soon as possible.

You will be taken to the next page where you will choose an [instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). Choose the `t2.micro` instance type which is **Free-Tier** compatible. The `t2.micro` instance type doesn’t provide the best nor most optimized compute capacity but will suffice for the purpose of this tutorial.

Skip through the 3rd, 4th and 5th steps without changing any of the default parameters as that’s outside of the scope of this tutorial. Head to the 6th step where we will configure a [Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html). Think of a **Security Group** as an imaginary firewall around an instance, filtering traffic into and out it.

Click on the **Add Rule** button and select `HTTP`, click on it again and select `HTTPS`. These will allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic in and out of the instance, making it accessible over the internet. The first rule, the `SSH` directive, will enable us `SSH` into the instance and make necessary updates, configurations, and installation.

![](/images/1__u2lIdYAcyHoZcSPNYx9IOg.png)

Once that’s done, click on the **Review and Launch** button.

Now Launch the instance. You will be prompted to select or create a new key pair. Select “Create a new key pair” and name it `myNVirginiaKeyPair`. Once this is done, download the key pair(make sure you do). Will will be using the downloaded key pair to `SSH` into our instance shortly.

Click on **Launch Instances** and wait for the instance to launch then click the **View Instances** button on the bottom right.

### Launching our Amazon RDS Database

Amazon RDS is a relational database service in AWS that enables you to launch fully-managed, relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, Amazon Aurora (High performance and available MySQL), PostgreSQL, MariaDB and Microsoft SQL Server.

We will create a **MySQL** database in **RDS** before installing Laravel on our **EC2** instance. This will give us the needed database endpoints to configure the Laravel web app with.

Navigate to the [RDS Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home) and click on the **Create Database** button

![](/images/1____pBGTRJgkdKT6wIuCBAmLQ.png)

Select the **MySQL** engine and click **Next**. Select the **Dev/Test** use case which keeps us within the **RDS Free Usage Tier.**

The next section is where we will specify the Database details. Select the `t2.micro` DB instance type, then scroll down to the **Settings** row at the bottom.

![](/images/1__TXnnulP1BdSNU__2RGaI7Pg.png)

Set the **DB instance identifier**, the **Master username,** the **Master Password** and the **Confirm Password** to `laravelaws`. You can use any value within the defined constraints but we will stick to `laravelaws` for the sake of simplicity.

Click on the **Next** button and you will be taken to the 4th section where we will configure advanced settings.

![](/images/1__r9gfWtLBmbCugrlgHxqnKA.png)

Scroll down to the **Database options** row where we will set the **Database name** to `laravelaws` also. Leave every other parameter as is and click the **Create database** button at the bottom. Now RDS will begin the instantiation of our **MySQL** database. This may take a few minutes. We will come back to get the generated endpoint with which we will connect the Laravel Web App to our **MySQL** database, through the internet.

**Remember**: Amazon RDS is a fully-managed service, thus `SSH` access to our MySQL database is prohibited. Amazon RDS takes care of OS patching, upgrading, automated backups and other database administrative processes for you.

The last thing we need to do is create a **Security Group** that will allow traffic through port `3306` to our MySQL database.

Navigate to **Security Groups** under **Network & Security** on the EC2 dashboard and click the **Create Security Group** button

![](/images/1__C7k8__eD__6__Nqbo75U1VpFg.png)

We will name the **Security Group** `RDS-SG`. Then add a **MYSQL/Aurora** rule that opens port `3306` access. Select `Anywhere` as source, then click **Create**.

Once this is done, head back to the Amazon RDS dashboard, select the `laravelaws` database and click on **Modify** button.

On the third row — **Network & Security —** click on **Security Group,** then add the newly created `RDS-SG` security group. Click **Continue** and then **Modify DB Instance.**

![](/images/1__yXF__OqVZh0VpQSvZzaF0KQ.png)

We can now connect to our **MySQL** DB instance via port `3306` with our endpoint and other DB credentials.

### **Connecting to the EC2 Instance via SSH**

Now that the instance is started and running, we need to grab the public IP address of the instance to enable us establish an `ssh` connection to it, together with the key pair we downloaded earlier.

> **Note**: If you are using a windows PC follow [**this guide**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html) on Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY.

![](/images/1__k7nyjAAt1zBwXjObw0FEMQ.jpeg)

Grad the Public IP address and navigate to the downloads folder the key pair is located. Now run the command:

```
ssh ec2-user@your_public_IP -i myNVirginiaKeyPair.pem
```

Make sure you are running this command in the folder that contains the `myNVirginiaKeyPair.pem` we downloaded earlier.

If all goes well, you should be prompted with the question _Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?_ , type `yes` and hit enter.

If you get any unprotected private key file warning, run the command

```
chmod 400 myNVirginiaKeyPair.pem
```
this will protect the `myNVirginiaKeyPair.pem` file against accidental overwriting. Now attempt the `ssh` connection again.

Yaay!! we have successfully established `ssh` connection with our EC2 instance. We can now install needed packages via the console.

### Installing Apache

Lets assume the role of a root user then upgrade system software to the latest version.
```
sudo su  
yum update -y
```

Lets install **Apache 2.2** and **PHP 7.2** and a new version of `mod_ssl`
```
yum install httpd24 -y

yum install php72 php72-mysqlnd php72-imap php72-pecl-memcache php72-pecl-apcu php72-gd php72-mbstring -y

yum install mod24\_ssl -y
```
Now let’s start **Apache**: run the command
```
service httpd start
```

You should get an `OK` response.

Go to your browser of choice and paste the **Public IP** address of the **EC2** instance. You should see a test page like below.

![](/images/1__P1j6KLBaZBeyfDRsswOMlw.png)

Now that Apache server is running, we can proceed to install our Laravel Web App, but first, we need to make sure that in the event our instance is restarted, for whatever reason, that **Apache** will be automatically started as soon as the instance comes on. That way we wouldn’t have to ssh into the instance then starting it on the console each time. We will do this by running:
```
chkconfig —add httpd

chkconfig httpd on
```
### Installing Laravel

We will install Laravel from its official [**Github repository**](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). But first we need to install `git` on our instance.
```
yum install git -y
```
Navigate to the **Apache** public folder:
```
cd /var/www/html
```
We will now clone **Laravel** from the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git
```
Now that we’ve cloned a fresh Laravel project, we need to reconfigure our **Apache** server to point to the Laravel directory. we will do this by copying the code below to the bottom of the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` file:
```
nano `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`
```
```
Alias / /var/www/html/laravel/public/
<Directory "/var/www/html/laravel/public">
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
</Directory>
```

Edit the `.htaccess` file:

```
nano /var/www/html/laravel/public/.htaccess
```
Then add `RewriteBase /` just below `RewriteEngine On`

We will create a `.env` file and specify the **MySQL** database endpoint generated by RDS earlier and other credentials.

Navigate to the RDS dashboard on the AWS console and click on the `laravelaws` DB instance. Scroll down to **Connectivity** to see the **Endpoint** generated for the **MySQL** database.

> **NB**: For those that may want to connect to the endpoint displayed below, this DB instance will be delete immediately after this tutorial.

![](/images/1__hUp8vL__pu7dmNme__EWlSTw.png)

Run the command(This copies the content of the `.env.example` file into a new file called `.env`):
```
cd /var/www/html/laravel  
mv .env.example .env  
nano .env
```
Paste in the code below. Make sure you substitute the `DB_HOST` parameter value for your generated **MySQL** endpoint(No http(s)://. Paste as is).

```
APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

LOG_CHANNEL=stack

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=<RDS ENDPOINT>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravelaws
DB_USERNAME=laravelaws
DB_PASSWORD=laravelaws

BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
```

Once done, press `^X`, then enter `y` to the prompted question and hit enter.

Now we need to give **Apache** write access to the storage folder, else Laravel will throw a write permission error.

```
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/laravel/storage
```

Let’s restart **Apache** to ensure immediate effect, and then return to the `laravel` folder:

```
service httpd restart  
cd /var/www/html/laravel
```

To install composer(make sure you’re in the `laravel` directory):

```
yum install wget -y
wget https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
```

Confirm installation by running:

```
php composer.phar
```
Now that we have `composer` installed, we will now install all needed Laravel packages specified in the `composer.json` file:
```
php composer.phar install
```
Generate Application key:
```
php artisan key:generate
```
Create Authentication scaffold:
```
php artisan make:auth
```
User session will be stored on the `database` instead of the `file` on the Ec2 instance. This is because, when we eventually scale our Laravel Web App, the Load Balancer will balance traffic request across all instances. So if my session file was stored on `instance 1` and my next request is directed to `instance 5`, `instance 5` will not have access to my session file on `instance 1`, thus it will ask that i re-authenticate myself. To avoid this, we will manage user sessions on the database, since all instances are connected and have access to it. Alternatively, we can make use of [**Amazon Elastic Cache**](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) that offers fully managed **Redis** and **Memcache**.

Create a sessions table migration:
```
php artisan session:table
```
Now let’s run Laravel migrations:
```
php artisan migrate
```
Paste the Public IP of your instance in your browser. You should see the **Laravel** welcome screen:

![](/images/1__X1tcdNcZ2gj43ZJfIedeSw.png)

We have now successfully installed and configured **Laravel** on our Amazon Ec2 instance. We have also linked it to our **MySQL** database. You can make login and registration attempts to test the app.

### Conclusion

In this article, we launched an EC2 instance and installed several packages and an **Apache** server on it, through an established `SSH` connection. Furthermore, we created a **MySQL** database instance on **Amazon RDS** and also installed a fresh Laravel application on the EC2 instance. This web application was eventually assessable on the web browser.

Here is the concluding part of this article, where we proceed to scale our Laravel Web application to enable it to handle high user traffic while maintaining availability:
